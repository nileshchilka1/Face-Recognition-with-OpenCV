# Face-Verification-with-OpenCV

### Overview
Here, I Developed Face Verification with OpenCV. This model can be deployed easily as OpenCV is Cross Platfrom.
To make model Robust try to take samples at different lightning Conditions.        

### Motivation
After understanding the basic Fundamentals of OpenCV, I thought to build a Face Verifiaction Model
